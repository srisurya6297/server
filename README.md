We move more and more towards using Vue.js in the frontend, starting with Settings. For building the code on changes, use these terminal commands in the root folder:

``` bash
# install dependencies
make dev-setup

# build for development
make build-js

# build for development and watch edits
make watch-js

# build for production with minification
make build-js-production
```

We still use Handlebars templates some places in Files and Settings. We will replace these step-by-step with Vue.js, but in the meantime you need to compile them separately.

If you donâ€™t have Handlebars installed yet, you can do it with this terminal command:
```
sudo npm install -g handlebars
```

Then inside the root folder of your local Nextcloud development installation, run this command in the terminal every time you changed a `.handlebars` file to compile it:
```
./build/compile-handlebars-templates.sh
```
